## How Seat Billing Works

A **seat** is any user account that was active (logged in or made an API call) at least once during the billing period.

- Seats are counted at the end of each billing month.
- Adding users mid-month is prorated to the day.
- Deactivating a user does **not** immediately free the seat — the account is counted until the billing month closes.
- **Overage:** if active users exceed the purchased seat count, overage is billed at 1.5× the per-seat rate.

**Common billing query:** "We're being charged for N seats but only have M active users."

Resolution steps:
1. Export the active user list: Settings → Users → Export → filter "Active in last 30 days".
2. Compare against the invoice seat count.
3. Check for service accounts and API users — these count as seats.
4. If a discrepancy remains after this check, raise a billing dispute with the exported list attached.

## Invoices & Payment

- Invoices are generated on the 1st of each month (monthly) or on the annual renewal date.
- Payment methods: credit card, ACH (US), SEPA (EU), wire transfer (Enterprise only).
- Invoices are available at Settings → Billing → Invoices.
- Invoice disputes must be raised within 30 days of issue date.
