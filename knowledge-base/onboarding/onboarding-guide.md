# Onboarding Guide — New Customers & Users

## New Organisation Onboarding Checklist

Complete these steps within the first 7 days to ensure a smooth rollout.

### Step 1: Account setup (Day 1)

- [ ] Verify the admin email and accept the invitation
- [ ] Set organisation name and region: Settings → Organisation → General
- [ ] Configure SSO if on Business/Enterprise plan: Settings → SSO (see [Authentication & SSO guide](../troubleshooting/authentication-sso.md))
- [ ] Set the default session timeout: Settings → Security → Session Timeout (recommended: 8 hours)

### Step 2: User provisioning (Days 1–3)

**Option A — Bulk CSV import:**
1. Download the template: Settings → Users → Import → Download Template.
2. Fill in: email, first name, last name, role (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).
3. Upload and confirm. Invitation emails are sent automatically.

**Option B — SSO auto-provisioning (Business/Enterprise):**
1. Configure your IDP to send SCIM provisioning events to the platform.
2. SCIM endpoint: `https://[product].yourdomain.com/scim/v2/`
3. Bearer token: generate at Settings → SSO → SCIM → Generate Token.
4. New IDP users are provisioned automatically within 5 minutes of their first SSO login.

**Option C — Manual invite:**
Settings → Users → Invite User → enter email and role.

## Bulk User Provisioning FAQ

**Q: How many users can I import at once?**  
A: CSV import supports up to 500 users per file. For larger imports, use SCIM or split into multiple CSVs.

**Q: What if an invited user doesn't receive the invitation email?**  
A: Check spam folders. If not found, resend from Settings → Users → [user] → Resend Invite. Invitations expire after 7 days.

**Q: Can I set different product access per user?**  
A: Yes — on Business/Enterprise, product-level permissions can be configured per user or per group: Settings → Users → [user] → Product Access.
