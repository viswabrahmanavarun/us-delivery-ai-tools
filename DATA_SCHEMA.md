## Joining Tickets to Accounts

Tickets reference accounts via `account_id`. Note:

- Not every `account_id` in `tickets.json` will have a matching record in `accounts.json`. This reflects real-world data gaps — handle gracefully.
- One account can have many tickets (one-to-many relationship).
- Use the last 90 days of tickets for account health analysis (filter by `created_at`).

```python
import json

tickets  = json.load(open("data/tickets.json"))
accounts = json.load(open("data/accounts.json"))

# Build account lookup
account_map = {a["account_id"]: a for a in accounts}

# Get tickets for a specific account
def get_account_tickets(account_id, tickets, days=90):
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
    cutoff = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=days)
    return [
        t for t in tickets
        if t["account_id"] == account_id
        and datetime.fromisoformat(t["created_at"].replace("Z", "+00:00")) > cutoff
    ]
```

## Knowledge Base Structure

```
knowledge-base/
├── products/           # One file per product — features, config, error codes
├── troubleshooting/    # Cross-product troubleshooting guides
├── billing/            # Plan details, seat billing, invoicing
└── onboarding/         # New user and new organisation setup
```

Each knowledge-base document is standard Markdown. For RAG implementations, recommended chunking strategy:
- Split on `---` horizontal rules (major section boundaries)
- Preserve heading hierarchy as metadata for retrieval filtering
- Table rows make good atomic chunks for error code lookups
